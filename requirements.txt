# ArG Project Specific Dependencies & Others from README Setup
# Versions for the following are not specified unless they overlap with LLaMA-Factory above.
# Consider pinning versions for stable builds.

# Langchain stack
langchain
langchain-openai
langchain-community

# Core ML/Execution
vllm
torch # Implicitly required by transformers, vllm, etc. Included for explicitness. Consider aligning with LLaMA-Factory's torch version if known.

# Vector Store & Embeddings
faiss-cpu # For FAISS vector store. For GPU support, install faiss-gpu and ensure CUDA compatibility.
# Note: BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5 embeddings are used by default in scripts.

# Data & Graph Handling
networkx
redis # For Langchain's RedisStore (optional caching, requires Redis server)
multiprocess # For parallel processing in data_creation
huggingface-hub # Often a peer dependency for transformers and datasets

# Utilities
tqdm # For progress bars
graphviz # For visualizations in notebooks (optional)
sparqlwrapper # For SPARQL queries in src/sparql_utils.py
pyodbc # For ODBC connection in src/sparql_utils.py (requires system-level ODBC drivers)
scikit-learn # For metrics in src/utils.py

# Note on 'walker':
# The import 'walker' is used in 'src/data_creation/relation_data.py' and 'src/graph_utils.py'.
# This appears to be a local module or a specific library not commonly found on PyPI.
# If it's a custom module within this project, ensure it's in PYTHONPATH.
# If it's an external dependency, its specific installation source needs to be identified.
# (e.g., if it were 'pywalker', one would add 'pywalker' to this list).
